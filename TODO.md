# TODO
- [ ] Add dynamic arrays in grids (start with somewhat smaller cells-arrays and increase their size if necessary). Useful to decrease a little bit the memory usage and hopefully it does not decrease the performance too much. See the [grid](lppydsmc/data_structures/grid.py).
- [ ] Add config files and readers (and think first about what things ought to be in config files and what others things should not)
- [ ] Better plotting package. Maybe use [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/gallery.html). Maybe solutions already exist online. Check with LPPIC team for a better plotting module too.
- [ ] add dependencies etc.
