def reflect(arr, vr_norm, mass1, mass2):
    """ Reflect particles following their collisions. Reflections are for now purely specular (no randomness).

    Args:
        arr (np.ndarray): 3D-array of size (number of actually colliding couples x 2 x 5)
        vr_norm (np.ndarray): relative velocity norm for each colliding couple
        masses (np.ndarray, optional): Mass for each particle, for each couple. If mass is the same for every particle, then use None as it simplified the computations.
                                       Defaults to None.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray  : Returns the new array with velocities having been updated accordingly.
                      Note that *arr* is in fact changed in place, however, we still return it in case it is needed  (in the case of 
                      the main algorithm *handler_particles_collisions*, *arr* is a copy and not a reference to the initial array).
