def get_possible_collisions(arr, walls, directing_vectors): # particles are considered as points
    """ Determine if there is a collision between the particule which position, velocity and radius 
    are given in parameters and the wall of index wall_indx. If there is, it compute the time to collision. 
    Note that this algorithms give the number of times a ray, defined by the particle position and future ones 
    (integrating its velocity without changing it), crosses the system boundaries. For simple polygonals geometry, 
    an even number means the particle is outside the boundaries while an odd number means the particle is inside.
    
    We suppose the particule is caracterized by its position (x,y), its velocity (vx, vy) and its radius r.
    The wall is caracterized by its two extremities : p1 = (x1,y1), p2 = (x2,y2) and its normal vector n directed toward the center (such that (p2-p1, n, (p2-p1) x n) is a direct system coordinate).

    The formula which is used is to compute the possible collision time is : 
        t_coll_1/2 = (-a sgn(b) +/- r)/|b| = (-a +/- r)/b
    where :
        * a = -x sin(theta) + y cos(theta)
        * b = -vx sin(theta) + vy cos(theta)
        * theta = sgn(ny) arccos(nx) 
        thus :  cos(theta) = nx
                sin(theta) = ny
        
    Note that theses times give the moment the disk crosses the infinite line formed from the wall,
    not strictly speaking the segment formed by the wall...

    If b = 0 : we consider that there is not collision and return t_coll = np.nan
    
    If b != O : then a necessary condition is to have both t_coll_1 > 0 and t_coll_2 > 0.
    Indeed : * The first time the particule collides, is when its closest point to the wall collides with it. 
             * The second time is for when the furthest point to the wall collided with it.
    In such a case, we have to verify that the disk crossing the line occurs on the portion of the line 
    which is the wall. To do that, we compute the position of the particule at the time of collision and verify that it 
    is on the "wall" segment. If it is we return t_coll = min(t_coll_1, t_coll_2). Else, np.nan.
