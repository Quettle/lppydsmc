# Note on Couette flow - which values

# We want to get a quasi-continuuss flow - let's say we target Kd = 0.1.
# Then with Iodine (sigma = 5e-19 mÂ²), we have : Kd = 1/(n*sigma*h)
# Where h=1e-3 m is the choosen caracteristic lenght (height of the tube) 
# This leads to : density = 2e24 m^-3
# For this, we have lambda = 1e-4 m (mean free path)
# thus we choose : dx = dy = 2.5e-5 m (dividing by 4 the mfp)
# thus, for a temperature of 300 K, we choose : dt = dx/v_mean ~ 1.25e-7s
# So let's take : dt = 1e-7s.
# The number of cells is h/dy = 40
# We can choose Nc = 100 particles per cell (there is a constraint on Nc for the validity of the simulation)
# For a target statistic accuracy, we see that the more we increase Nc, the less frames we need to have a given accuracy
# accuracy = 1/(Nc*nb_iterations)
# Thus, lowering Nc does not bring less computations time in a first approximation
# Then we need to choose the speed of the wall : the bigger it is, the less particles we need (because relative noise diminishes)
# we can choose for example : 100m/s (roughly half the mean speed at T=300K)
# We target for example an accuracy of 5%, meaning we want a "noise" that is less than 5% of the signal, if the signal is of amplitude the speed of the wall
# (close to the other wall, the speed should be very low and we would have much bigger noise)
# and also, we will average over each cell (here 40)
# Thus we need at least (there is a formula giving this number) **3066** iterations
# after we reached the steady state
# for this steady state to be reached, we need to get a relaxation time towards equilibrium first (without walls, simply for a uniform velocity distrib)
# and then get the number of iterations to wait for it.
